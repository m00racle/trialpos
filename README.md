2. Manage session of each user.

### login

The app does not provides any other link to access the web app functions.
- User does not have the privileges' to create their own user account since in POS app all user account are given by the admin.
- If the user forget about their password, they only have one solution to call the admin to reset their password.

This way it will make the app more secure since this app is most likely used by internal management which only provides account access to verified employees.
